# Olympic-Igloo

For the Winter Olympics igloo building event there are three judges, each of which gives a score from 0 to 50 (inclusive), 
but the lowest score is thrown out and the competitor's overall score is just the sum of the two highest scores. 
This program supports the recording of the three judge's scores, and the computing of the competitor's overall score.
